Description
We live in a very interesting time when everything is changing dramatically soon, and we are one of the first generations for which an environment where you were born is very different from an environment when you are old. With respect to the current environment the test task will be about out of space.

Please develop a one-page website which helps people to explore NASA`s expeditions to Mars.
The website should provide an ability for the user to select a Rover(Curiosity, Opportunity, Spirit), Camera(Front, Rear, …) and Sol(Mars day). After the Rover, Camere and Sol were selected, the website should show the images were done by the Rover. It might be a big number of images for each Sol(Mars day) so the app should have a pagination. The pagination should be implemented in a way “Load more…” button.

Using material design, please make sure that the website is pretty as much as possible as this test task is for the front-end where look and feel play a huge role.
